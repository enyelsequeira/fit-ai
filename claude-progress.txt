   - Installs dependencies
   - Pushes database schema
   - Seeds exercise library (optional)
   - Starts development servers
   - Supports --skip-seed, --api-only, --web-only flags

3. Verified project structure
   - Confirmed existing router structure follows contract pattern
   - All major routers exist: exercise, workout, goals, template, recovery, analytics, ai, settings, etc.
   - Frontend has comprehensive component library
   - Database schema files exist for all tables

=== PROJECT STATUS ===

Existing Infrastructure:
- Monorepo with pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- Frontend: React 19 + TanStack Start + TanStack Router
- Backend: Hono + oRPC on Cloudflare Workers
- Database: Drizzle ORM with SQLite/D1
- Auth: better-auth
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- 15 API routers implemented
- Multiple frontend pages and components

Feature Status: 0/107 features passing
All features in feature_list.json start with "passes": false

=== NEXT SESSION SHOULD ===

1. Run type checking (pnpm check-types) to identify any TypeScript errors
2. Run tests (pnpm test) to verify existing functionality
3. Start implementing/verifying features from feature_list.json in order:
   - Begin with auth features (auth-001 through auth-013)
   - Then exercise features (exercise-001 through exercise-022)
   - Continue in priority order

4. For each feature:
   - Test manually or write automated test
   - Fix any issues found
   - Update feature_list.json to "passes": true only when fully working

5. Key files to reference:
   - feature_list.json - Source of truth for features
   - app_spec.txt - Full specification
   - CLAUDE.md - Development commands and patterns
   - init.sh - Quick environment setup

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

- NEVER remove or edit feature descriptions in feature_list.json
- Only change "passes": false to "passes": true when feature is verified
- Commit progress frequently with descriptive messages
- Project already has substantial infrastructure - focus on verification and completion
